# little-coder

**A Claude Code-inspired CLI coding agent, heavily optimized for small models that run on any modern consumer laptop.**

little-coder takes the architecture of a cloud-powered coding assistant and makes it work with 5–25 GB local models served via Ollama **or llama.cpp**, through skill-augmented tool use, domain-knowledge injection, workspace-aware context discovery, a Write-vs-Edit tool invariant, and a thinking-budget system that prevents reasoning models from hanging while preserving their partial insights.

**Headline result (v0.0.5):** `llamacpp/qwen3.6-35b-a3b` (Qwen3.6-35B-A3B MoE — 35B total / 3B active, Q4_K_M ~22 GB) + little-coder scores **78.67%** on the full 225-exercise Aider Polyglot benchmark, running on an 8 GB laptop GPU with no network calls. That places the agent well inside the public leaderboard's top-10 band. See [`docs/benchmark-qwen3.6-35b-a3b.md`](docs/benchmark-qwen3.6-35b-a3b.md) for the full breakdown.

**Earlier baseline (v0.0.2):** `ollama/qwen3.5` (9.7B, 6.6 GB) + little-coder scored **45.56% mean** across two full runs — still above gpt-4.5-preview (44.9%) and gpt-oss-120b high (41.8%) on the public leaderboard. A matched-model vanilla Aider baseline reaches 19.11%.

> **The full narrative — motivation, design, methodology, results, leaderboard comparison, integrity audit, and limitations — is in the white paper at https://itayinbarr.substack.com/p/honey-i-shrunk-the-coding-agent** This README is the quick tour: what it looks like, how to run it, and how the repo is laid out. For anything about *why* the design is the way it is or *what the numbers mean*, read the paper.

## What it looks like

![little-coder startup banner](assets/banner.svg)

Every time you're about to type, the status line shows how much context you've burned and projects how many more messages you can send before a new session is recommended. Zones at 70% (yellow) and 85% (red) match the threshold that triggers automatic compaction:

![context usage and session counter](assets/status_line.svg)

When you ask little-coder to implement something, the agent uses the workspace-awareness skill to discover any spec file (`.docs/instructions.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `README.md`), reads the stub, and then **Edits** it in place. On the occasions it tries to `Write` over an existing file, the tool-level guard refuses and hands the agent the exact Edit recipe for the same path:

## Quick start

### Option A — Ollama (simplest)

```bash
# 1. Install Ollama
curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh

# 2. Pull a model
ollama pull qwen3.5

# 3. Clone + install little-coder
git clone https://github.com/itayinbarr/little-coder.git
cd little-coder
pip install -e .

# 4. Run
python little_coder.py
# Then in the REPL:  /model ollama/qwen3.5
```

### Option B — llama.cpp (fastest, supports MoE models like Qwen3.6-35B-A3B)

```bash
# 1. Build llama.cpp with CUDA (sm_XXX matches your GPU; Blackwell = 120)
git clone https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp && cd llama.cpp
cmake -B build -DGGML_CUDA=ON -DCMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES=120 -DLLAMA_CURL=ON
cmake --build build --config Release -j

# 2. Fetch a GGUF (example: Qwen3.6-35B-A3B Q4_K_M, 22 GB)
pip install -U "huggingface_hub[cli]"
hf download unsloth/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-GGUF Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-UD-Q4_K_M.gguf \
   --local-dir ~/models

# 3. Serve it (MoE trick: keep experts in RAM, attention on GPU)
build/bin/llama-server -m ~/models/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-UD-Q4_K_M.gguf \
   --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8888 --jinja \
   -c 16384 -ngl 99 --n-cpu-moe 999 --flash-attn on

# 4. Point little-coder at it
cd /path/to/little-coder && pip install -e .
python little_coder.py --model llamacpp/qwen3.6-35b-a3b
# or for the 9B backup:  --model llamacpp/qwen3.5-9b
```

Set `LLAMACPP_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8888/v1` if you run the server on a different host or port.

### Option C — vLLM (remote or local OpenAI-compatible server)

```bash
# 1. Clone + install little-coder
git clone https://github.com/itayinbarr/little-coder.git
cd little-coder
pip install -e .

# 2. Configure your vLLM endpoint and API key
python little_coder.py
# Then in the REPL:
/config vllm_base_url=http://your-server:port/v1
/config vllm_api_key=your-key

# 3. Set the model (use the name vLLM reports in /v1/models)
/model vllm/your-model-name
```

You can also set these via environment variables:

```bash
export VLLM_BASE_URL=http://your-server:port/v1
export VLLM_API_KEY=your-key
python little_coder.py --model vllm/your-model-name
```

The `/model` command will auto-query your vLLM server to list available models.

## Supported models
